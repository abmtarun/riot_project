##  Introduction ##
"WareSage" is a made-up word that combines "ware" (from "warehouse") and "sage." In this context, "sage" conveys the idea of wisdom, knowledge, and expertise. So, "WareSage" implies a smart and knowledgeable system for warehouse management and control, which aligns with the concept of a smart warehouse system with IoT sensors and advanced technology.



***WareSage:***
Represents a system for managing and optimizing warehouse operations. Implies wisdom, knowledge, and expertise in warehouse management.

***The Smart IoT:***
Signifies the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Indicates the system's capability to collect real-time data from sensors for intelligent decision-making.

***Logistics Nexus:***
Suggests that the system serves as a central hub or focal point for logistics operations. Highlights the system's role in connecting and coordinating various aspects of warehouse logistics.

RIOT OS is an open-source real-time operating system designed for the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems. FIT IoT-Lab is a large-scale, open-access IoT testbed that provides a realistic environment for testing and developing IoT applications. Integrating RIOT OS with FIT IoT-Lab offers a powerful combination for IoT development and research.

We are excited to introduce the integration of RIOT OS and FIT IoT-Lab with our smart warehouse system, WareSage. This integration represents a significant leap in our warehouse management capabilities, combining advanced IoT technologies with real-world testing and remote monitoring.

##  Sensors for Smart Management ##
WareSage integrates three types of sensors to enable intelligent management:
-   _Temperature Sensors_: These sensors provide real-time temperature data, allowing for precise climate control within the warehouse. Automated adjustments to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems ensure optimal conditions for stored goods.
-   _Pressure Sensors_: Utilized for asset tracking and security, pressure sensors monitor goods' condition during transportation. Real-time tracking and security enhancements are achieved through this sensor.
-   _Luminosity Sensors_: Luminosity sensors are employed for efficient lighting control and security enhancement. The system automates lighting based on natural light levels and detects unusual lighting conditions that may indicate unauthorized access.

The whole setup is done by 'RIOT OS' on 'IoT-LAB'

IOT_LAB M3 board contains all these sensors. 

Sensors:  
1. Temperature Sensor (LPS331AP): It measures temperature in Celcius
2.  Pressure Sensor (LPS331AP): It measures atmospheric pressure in hPa.
3.  Luminosity (Light) Sensor (ISL29020): It measures ambient light intensity in lux.

## Real-world Testing and Remote Monitoring ##

- RIOT OS applications have been developed to run on our chosen IoT devices for real-time sensor data collection.
- FIT IoT-Lab's real-world testing capabilities have allowed us to deploy these devices within our warehouse, collecting invaluable    data under actual operating conditions.
- We have seamlessly integrated FIT IoT-Lab's remote access features with our WareSage system, enabling remote monitoring and control of our IoT devices.

## Setup ##


To be able to connect to an IoT-LAB site server, you have to add your SSH key to your user account.
 1.  Generate a pair of SSH keys from the VS Code Terminal:
```
rm -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa* && ssh-keygen -q -N "" -C iot-lab-training -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
 2.  Get the SSH public key by running the following cell:
```
iotlab-auth --add-ssh-key
```

 3.  Copy the output of the previous command and add it as authorized SSH key for your account:  
    [https://www.iot-lab.info/testbed/account](https://www.iot-lab.info/testbed/account)  (SSH Keys tab)
    
 4. Verify the setup by connecting to the Lyon's server site running the
    following command in the Terminal:

```
ssh $IOTLAB_LOGIN@lyon.iot-lab.info
```    
5. Clone the RIOT OS repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git
```
    
## Experiment: Sensors ##
To run the application the most important thing is to follow the path. For this application, the path in the Makefile is like this. If you change the path remember to fix this. 

RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../../RIOT

First you have to go to the Sensors directory

Then open a terminal and go to the folder containing the main.c and make file.

Select an environment with the following command. We have always chosen the grenoble site. 
```
env SITE=grenoble
```
Submit an experiment using the following command:
```
iotlab-experiment submit -n "iot_sensors_data" -d 20 -l 1,archi=m3:at86rf231+site=$SITE
```
Here the experiment will last 20 minutes. It can be modified. Similarly, the site can be changed by modifying the value of the SITE variable in the command. 

After that we have to wait to see the 'Running' status.

Then write the following command:
```
iotlab-experiment wait --timeout 30 --cancel-on-timeout

```
Get the experiment nodes list:
```
iotlab-experiment --jmespath="items[*].network_address | sort(@)" get --nodes

```
Now put this command
```
source /opt/riot.source

```
Build and flash using the following command

```
make IOTLAB_NODE=auto flash
```

To see the results, go to the "My experiments" section on Iot-LAB. Open the terminal in the experiment section. Over there you will see the temperature, pressure and luminocity values. 
You will get the following result:

## Experiment: COAP ##

Secondly, we tried to communicate between two IOT LAB nodes using the Coap protocol.


Now first you have to come out from the Sensors directory and have to go the Coap directory. 

Open two terminals in VS Code. 

Select an environment with the following command. We have always chosen the grenoble site. 
```
env SITE=grenoble
```
Write the following command
```
source /opt/riot.source
```
Now write the following command
```
make
```
Submit the first experiment using the following command:
```
iotlab-experiment submit -n Coap -d 60 -l grenoble,m3,3,./bin/iotlab-m3/Coap.elf
```
Submit the second experiment using the following command:
```

iotlab-experiment submit -n Coap -d 60 -l grenoble,m3,4,./bin/iotlab-m3/Coap.elf
```
Wait for the experiment to be in the Running state
```
iotlab-experiment wait --timeout 30 --cancel-on-timeout
```
Get the experiment nodes list:
```
iotlab-experiment --jmespath="items[*].network_address | sort(@)" get --nodes
```

You can see the Output

![Image2](/Coap/Coap-1.PNG)-
![Image3](/Coap/coap-2.PNG)

In the first terminal, which we will now call the coap server, you can type the following command: 
```
nc m3-4 20000
```
After that press enter and then type: 

```
ifconfig
```
you will get the IP V6 address of the coap server.

You can also use the  coap info command to know the port in which it is listening :

```
coap info
```
The server listens usually on port 5683. 

Now go to the second terminal.
Enter the following command to set up the client. 
```
nc m3-3 20000
```
You can then test communication with the second node, the coap client.
 by typing the following command in the second terminal followed by the server's IPV6 address. You will get this address from the first terminal. 
```
ping <IPV6 Address>
```

To check wheather the client is properly working or not type the following command to retrieve  the temperature values from the sensor.
```
coap get <ipv6>  5683 /temperature
```
Remember to replace ```<ipv6>``` by the IP V6 adress of the server.


Now you can see the temperature properly.

 That means, the two servers are communicating properly. 

##  Cloud Setup

1. Create EC2 instance 

2. Assign IPv6 subnet:

COPY . /app

# Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir requirements.txt

# Run your Python script when the container launches
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

10. The requirements.txt file should have the following
```
aiocoap==0.4
influxdb==5.3.1
```

11. Build Docker image
```
docker build -t python-app .
```

12. Run the docker container
```
docker run python-app
